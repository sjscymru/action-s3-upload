# Deploy S3 Github Action üöÄ

Github action to deploy a folder, or a single file to an Amazon S3 bucket. This project is a fork of the excellent work of
[lewandy/vue-s3-deployer](https://github.com/lewandy/vue-s3-deployer). The main differences are:

* No build step included (so you can build the project with yarn or npm)
    * This allows to cache node_modules / yarn / npm 
    * No need to install and compile files again (faster build)
* Official [AWS-CLI docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/aws-cli)
* Configurable `DIST` folder (you can specify if is `dist`, `build` or `lib`)
* Configurable `PATH` in bucket (allowing for uploads for PRs, etc.)

## Usage

In your workflow, define a step which refers to the action:

```yaml
      - name: Deploying application to Amazon S3
        uses: dvelasquez/deploy-s3-action@main
        with:
          AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: ${{ secrets.AWS_DEFAULT_REGION }}
          AWS_BUCKET_NAME: ${{ secrets.AWS_BUCKET_NAME }}
          BUCKET_PATH: "" # Or to upload a pull_request: "/pr/${{github.event.number}}"
          DIST_LOCATION_CODE: ./dist
```

### Configuration

These settings are environment variables that the action will use for make the deployment. Below we describe each variable.

| Key | Value | Required | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | AWS Access Key. [More info here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | AWS Secret Access Key. [More info here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html) | **Yes** | N/A |
| `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` | The name of the bucket you're syncing to. For example, `vue-action`. | **Yes** | N/A |
| `BUCKET_PATH` | The path within the bucket in which to upload the folder (or file). | No | '/'
| `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` | The region of the bucket. Set to `us-east-1` by default. [Full list of regions here.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using- | **Yes** | N/A
| `DIST_LOCATION_CODE` | Distribution files to be uploaded | **yes** |
| `SINGLE_FILE` | Flag to indicate if the value of `DIST_LOCATION_CODE` points to a single file. This is used by the action to determine if the `cp` or `sync` command should be used on the AWS CLI tool. | No | false |./
